ARRAYS
1.It is a sequentially-allocated data structure of a fixed-size. It is indexed and allows for the random access of items.
2.Can be allocated both statically and dynamically.
3.Using indexes,append functions,etc we can put and get numbers in an array depending on th language being used.
4.They are used to mainly refer to a collection of variables of the same type or matrices or to implemement other DS also

LINKED LIST
1.LinkedList is ideal for sequential access.
2. Dynamic memory allocation is referred for Linked lists.
3.We can use get() or iterate() methods
4.They can be used to implement stacks, queues, and other abstract data types.


STACK
1.Stack are in RAM and are accessed using stack pointer register.
2.Supports both static and dynamic allocation
3.Using push and pop we can put and get numbers.
4.Used in expression evaluationa and backtracking algorithms.

QUEUE
1.Supports sequential access.
2.Supports both static and dynamic allocation
3.Using enqueue and dequeue operations we can put and get numbers.
4.Used in CPU task scheduling,disk scheduling,etc.
